We've just taken on a mature garden: just under an acre with an orchard, a
large set of vegetable beds, mature trees and mixed ornamental beds and
borders. Join me as I learn about what I've taken on and add even more to
make this a fully wildlife-friendly, edible, ornamental garden on my
journey to live a more sustainable life.
