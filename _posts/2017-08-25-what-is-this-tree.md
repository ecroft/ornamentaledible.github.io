I don't know what this tree is. I think it might be euonymus hamiltonianus
(spindle tree). It's in the Celastraceae family. It's got lovely four-lobed
berries on it at the moment and the foliage is starting to turn maroon at the
edges of the tips. Apparently the pink-red berries should open out to expose
bright orange seeds and is great for birds.
